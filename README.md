# TIY Durham - TA Tool
## Ruby Student Challenges
This tool creates files for student challenges in separate folders based on the challenge name

## Use
* Edit the array called `names` in the executable file `create_files.rb` with each students name.

* Execute this file from the command line and give it an option with the challenge name.

  `ruby create_files.rb challenge_name`

* This will create a new folder named with the `challenge_name` with nested files for each student.

* Copy/Paste each student's code (from their Gist) into their respective files and then run those files to see if the challenge was completed.
